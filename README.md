# CS9643_Data_Structure
Data Structure and Algorithm using python


Project 1: To implement a stack using linkedlist, performed a depth first search and also familiar with command line arguments

To run the program, simply "python DFS.py m1.txt 0.5 True/False". 

sys.arg 1 represents the maze we are going to run. 
sys.arg 2 represents the time delay for each step.
sys.arg 3 represents the Flag, meaning the detection sequence. When it is false, we will detect as top, right, bot and left. When it is true, the detection sequence will be random and we will run the maze for 30 times. Then get the mean, std of the 30 runs.
